## My Review

Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's most ambitious and emotional film. It's a mind-bending sci-fi epic that explores black holes, time dilation, and the survival of humanity - but at its heart, it's about a father's love for his daughter. The scientific concepts are complex yet accessible, and the visuals are absolutely stunning.

Hans Zimmer's score is legendary, using organs to create a sense of both grandeur and intimacy. Matthew McConaughey's performance grounds all the cosmic spectacle in real human emotion.
