## My Review

The first Pirates of the Caribbean film is pure swashbuckling fun. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is an iconic character - unpredictable, hilarious, and somehow always one step ahead. The film takes what could have been a theme park ride cash-grab and turns it into a genuinely entertaining adventure with heart.

The action sequences are creative and exciting, the humor lands perfectly, and there's real chemistry between all the leads. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is delightfully menacing, and the curse concept is cleverly executed.
