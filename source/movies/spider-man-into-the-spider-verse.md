## My Review

Into the Spider-Verse is a game-changer. It revolutionized animation by making a film that looks like a living comic book. Every frame is a work of art, with multiple animation styles blending seamlessly. But beyond the groundbreaking visuals, it tells a genuinely moving story about finding your own path and living up to responsibility.

Miles Morales is a relatable, complex protagonist, and the film's message about how anyone can wear the mask is powerful and inclusive. The humor is sharp, the action is inventive, and the emotional beats hit hard.
