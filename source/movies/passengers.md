## My Review

Passengers is a thought-provoking sci-fi romance that asks difficult moral questions while delivering stunning visuals and emotional depth. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence have great chemistry, and the film does an excellent job exploring themes of loneliness, choice, and redemption.

The production design is incredible - the spaceship Avalon feels both luxurious and isolating. While the moral dilemma at the heart of the story is controversial, it makes for compelling viewing and genuine emotional conflict.
