## My Review

Forrest Gump is a beautiful, bittersweet journey through American history seen through the eyes of an extraordinary ordinary man. Tom Hanks delivers one of the greatest performances in cinema history, making Forrest both innocent and wise. The film perfectly balances humor and heartbreak, never feeling manipulative despite its emotional weight.

What makes this film special is how it treats Forrest's disability with dignity while showing that his different perspective on life might actually be clearer than everyone else's. It's a film about kindness, loyalty, and the unpredictability of life.
