## My Review

Castle in the Sky is pure Miyazaki magic - an adventure story filled with wonder, imagination, and heart. The world-building is extraordinary, creating a steampunk fantasy that feels both whimsical and grounded. Pazu and Sheeta's friendship is genuinely touching, and the film perfectly balances action, humor, and emotional moments.

Joe Hisaishi's score is absolutely legendary, especially the main theme which still gives me chills every time. The animation, even by today's standards, is beautiful and full of life.
